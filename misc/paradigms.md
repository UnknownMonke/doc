# Programming Paradigms

#

High-level way to structure and conceptualize the implementation of a computer program.

Common programming paradigms :

- **Imperative** – Code directly controls execution flow and state change.
    
    - **Procedural** – Organized as procedures that call each other.

    - **Object-oriented** – Organized as objects that contain both data structure and associated    behavior.

- **Declarative** – Code declares properties of the desired result, but not how to compute it.
    
    - **Functional** – A desired result is declared as the value of a series of function evaluations.
    
    - **Reactive** – A desired result is declared though data streams and the propagation of change.
