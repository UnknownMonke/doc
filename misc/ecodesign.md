Some keys elements to take into account when developping web applications :

- **Expiry** & **decommission** of data.
- Future of freed up hardware and resources.
- **Scalability** and **efficiency**, use only the necessary resources.

<br>

> About 45% of the requested features are never used, and 70% are not essential.

Solutions :

- **Mobile first** approach, one app many devices.
- Data management tools.
- Wide use of **caching**.
- Control files & images sizes, format and resolutions.
- **Functions as a service** : mobilize the resource (server space / boot) only when requested.
- **Microservices** : divide resources towards elemental block using only the minimal required.
