## Environment

**<u>JDK</u>** : Java Development Kit

- Provides the tools to debug, compile and execute Java programs.
- JDK contains the JRE with Java compiler.

**<u>JVM</u>** : Java Virtual Machine

- Responsible for converting the byte code to machine code when executing a Java program.
- Provides Memory management, Garbage Collection, Security, etc.
- Provides platform independence through the VM.

**<u>JRE</u>** : Java Runtime Environment

- Holds the implementation of the JVM.
- Only contains tools to execute (and not compile) a Java program (Jar/War).

<br>

## Exceptions

### Checked Exceptions

- Must be declared in a throw clause : `method() throws Exception`.

- Must be handled in the methods it is thrown in or the code *will not compile*.

- Can also be passed to parent methods if added to a clause : **bad practice**.

#
### Unchecked Exceptions

- No need to handle them in place : *non blocking* throw.

- Parents methods don't know about it.

- No need to be declared in a throw clause.

- Can be handled from **anywhere**.

- `RunTimeException` & subclasses :
    - `ClassCastException`
    - `NullPointerException`

<br>

## Language specifics

### Annotations

- Can be parsed by a tool or the compiler and are available at **runtime**.

- Built-in annotations :

    - `@Override` for inheritance.
    - `@Deprecated`.
    - `@SuppressWarnings`.
    - `@FunctionalInterface`.
    - `@SafeVarargs`.

- Custom annotation :

    - Interface annotated with `@Interface`.
    - No parameters.
    - Can have meta annotations attached.

#
### Class Loader

- Loads the compiled .class files into the JVM memory.

- Built-in classloaders :
    - Bootstrap : loads JDK internal classes.
    - Extension : loads from /extensions directory.
    - System : loads from the current classpath.

- Access : `MyClass.class.getClassLoader();`.

- Class loaders delegate to their parent loader when loading a class, if not found in the range of the parent, the loader attempts to load the class itself.

#
### Inheritance

- Hierarchy b/w classes : **transitive**.

- Private members are hidden and need **getters** & **setters**.

<br>

``` java
Cat c = new Cat();  
Animal a = c;        // Fine.  
Cat c1 = (Cat) a;    // Explicit casting works because c is of type Animal.

Animal a = new Animal();
Cat c1 = (Cat) a;    // ClassCastException.
```
#
### Interfaces

- Abstract Class.

- Methods are abstract and public by default, and do not have a body, except for default methods.

- Attributes are by default public static final.

#
### Functional Interface

- Interface of only 1 method, annotated `@FunctionalInterface`.

- Purpose :
    - Removes boilerplate code.
    - Can use lambda to instantiate them.
    - ex : `java.util.Function`.

- FI can have non-abstract Object methods, such as `equals()`.

#
### Pass-by-value

- Java is *pass-by-value*, not *pass-by-reference*.

- *Pass-by-value* : the method parameters are copied to another variable. The method uses the copy.

- *Pass-by-reference* : a reference to the Object is passed to the method. The method uses the actual parameter.

#
### Increment operators

- **Post-increment** Operator `a++` :

``` java
t = a;
a = a + 1;
return t;
```
`a` is incremented, old value is returned.

<br>

- **Pre-increment** Operator `++a` :

``` java
a = a + 1;
return a;
```
`a` is incremented, new value is returned.

#
### StringBuilder vs StringBuffer

| StringBuffer | StringBuilder    |
|--------------|------------------|
| Thread-safe  | Not Thread-safe  |
| Synchronized | Not synchronized |
| Slower       | Faster           |

#
### String manipulation

Important for several reasons :

- Data cleaning (remove spaces, special chars...).

- Parsing small parts of large datasets.

- Formatting for communication b/w systems or user-friendly outputs.

- Pattern matching for search.

#
### Immutability

- Enhances performances by reusing existing Objects.

- Can lead to a drop in performances for large Objects as a new Object is created with each manipulation.

- Contributes to safer code, Objects can be used as keys without fear of unexpected change.

- **Thread-safe**.

#
### Miscellaneous

- String class is final and immutable.

- <u>All</u> primitive wrappers extend the `java.lang.Number` class.

- `compareTo()` returns 0 if equal, < 0 if before the parameter in lexical order, and > 0 if after.

- `s1.concat(s2)` returns a new String and does not modify the existing String.

- The `+` operator has precedence over `==` : 
`"result : " + string1 == string2` will transform to `"result : string1" == "string2"` and return `false`.
